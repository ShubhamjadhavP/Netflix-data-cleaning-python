# 📺 Netflix-data-cleaning-python
Data cleaning project on the Netflix dataset to prepare it for analysis and visualization. Covers null handling, date parsing, value corrections, and exporting a clean CSV file.

## 🔍 Objective
To preprocess and clean the dataset by:
- Handling missing values
- Parsing dates correctly
- Correcting misaligned data
- Preparing the data for future analysis or dashboarding

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Missingno (for missing value visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔄 Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset and explored data types and null values
2. Replaced missing countries, directors, and cast values with "Unknown"
3. Filled `date_added` missing values with a default "June 1st" and respective `release_year`
4. Corrected misaligned values in `rating` and `duration`
5. Exported the cleaned data to CSV
